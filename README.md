## Profile
My name is Michael and I am a second year MURP student. Before entering Luskin, I worked as a graphic designer for 8 years for education, finance, and technology companies. Additionally, I am an aspiring birder â€“ I'm always open to tips or suggestions!
## Course description
## Project ideas
My research interests focus on economic inclusion through digital equity. My capstone project is focused on broadband adoption rates and what factors, in addition to high cost, prevent individuals, households, and communities from connecting to the internet. Ideally, I would like to identify communities with low rates of broadband access then identify associated barriers, for example: 
* banking status
* employment type/schedule
* citizenship status
* number of individuals in residence 
## Class objectives
Working as a designer I have always leveraged proprietary software to create graphics, webistes, and videos; I would like to add open-source and coding skills to my  toolkit to push my visual communication skills further. At a more conceptual level, I would like to become a more proficient storyteller
